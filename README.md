# Workday-Planner
A Simple Calendar Application that Schedules Events and saves them in the console, through the power of JQuery. Included is a updated HTML and CSS that were linked to the Moment.js library to access the date.

## Description
This simple day planner loops through the current day's hours (8am-5pm) when the user opens the app. The app has to access moment.js to handle the date and time. The application allows for adding, editting, and removing saved text by clicking on the submit icon. The data is saved into the localStorage and produces a color coded system of time passing. Hours that have passed are displayed gray, the current time is displayed red, and future hours are displayed green. 

### Completed Tasks
